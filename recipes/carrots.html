    <h3>Description</h3> How to roast the perfect carrots.
  
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds carrots</li>
        <li>1/3 cup butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
       
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking oil spray; set aside.</li>
        <li>Trim ends of carrots and cut into thirds.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a pan or skillet over medium-heat. Pour in honey and cook, while stirring, until completely melted through the butter. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant while stirring.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and allow the sauce to thicken for a further minute, while tossing the carrots through the sauce. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Transfer carrots to baking sheet in a single layer so they cook evenly. Toss to evenly coat.</li>
        <li>Roast for 20 minutes, or until carrots are fork-tender. Broil (or grill) for 2-3 minutes on high heat to crisp/char the edges.</li>
        <li>Season with a little extra salt and pepper if desired. Garnish with parsley and enjoy.</li>
